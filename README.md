# N-Body Code :apple:

This repository aims to create an **N-body** code for simulating test particles in a system. Currently, it is developed for a Monash University project in ASP3012 - Stars and Galaxies. It aims to simulate particles in a galaxy colliding with each other. It is a simple experiment and makes use of simple integrators in Python.

This code is currently unfinished and being worked on.

### Setup :scroll:

Make sure the following Python3 packages are installed:

```
pip3 install matplotlib
pip3 install numpy
```

To run the N-body code, run the following line inside the project directory:
```
./main.py
```
